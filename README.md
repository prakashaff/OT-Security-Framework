## ðŸ“– About the Project

This site organizes OT security topics into an interactive tree-style structure â€” similar to the OSINT Framework â€” making it easy to navigate and understand:

- OT security tools and techniques  
- Standards and compliance (NIST, IEC 62443, ISO 27001)  
- Risk assessment, asset protection, and architecture  
- Threat intelligence and detection (MITRE ATT&CK for ICS)  
- Resources for audits, hardening, and awareness  

Itâ€™s a **static site** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” fast, simple, and fully open-source.
